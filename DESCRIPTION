Description: Performs diagnostics for the implied weights of linear regression for estimating causal effects. 
             These diagnostics rely on the finding presented in Chattopadhyay and Zubizarreta (2021) <http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06581> that 
             using outcome regression to estimate causal effects is equivalent to computing a weighted difference in outcome means, where
             the weights have a particular formulation and interesting properties that make them comparable to inverse probability weights 
             in form and function, but with greater potential for extrapolation in exchange for lower variance. 'lmw' provides tools
             to diagnose representativeness, balance, extrapolation, and influence for these models, clarifying the target population
             of inference. Tools are also available to simplify estimating treatment effects for specific target populations of interest.
